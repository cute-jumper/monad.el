#+TITLE: monad.el

(WIP) Toy implementation of monads in Emacs Lisp.

*Just for fun! Don't take this seriously!*

Note: The lexical binding must be enabled to make this work

* Do Notation
  : (monad-do type
  :    &rest body)

  The type can be one of (The list might increase over time)
  - =Maybe=
  - =State=

  The body contains a list of sexps in the form of =(var monad)= except for the
  last expression. If you don't want to bind anything, use =(_ monad)= or just
  =(monad)=. Since that since =do= notation doesn't allow you to bind any
  variable in the last expression, so the last sexp is only =monad=, not
  =(monad)=. =if= special form is also supported in the body, and =return= is
  also allowed.

* Maybe Monad
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (monad-do Maybe
    (x (Just 4))
    (y (if (= x 4)
           (return 5)
         (return -4)))
    (return (+ x y)))
  ;; => (Just . 9)
  #+END_SRC

* State Monad
  The following example comes from [[http://learnyouahaskell.com/][lyah]]:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun stack-pop ()
    (State (lambda (s) (list (car s) (cdr s)))))

  (defun stack-push (a)
    (State (lambda (s) (list nil (cons a s)))))

  (State-run
   (monad-do State
     (x (State-get))
     (y (stack-pop))
     (z (stack-pop))
     ((if (= (length x) 3)
          (State-put '(200))
        (State-put '(100))))
     ((stack-push y))
     (_ (stack-push z))
     (return x))
   '(8 9 10))
  ;; => ((8 9 10) (9 8 200))
  #+END_SRC
